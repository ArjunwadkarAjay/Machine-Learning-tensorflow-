Note:
This example uses the Machine Learning Neural network for predicting Xor values.
Here ,I learnt about the need for MultiLayer Perceptron as the Xor problem is not linear.
The Screenshot above shows the Visual representation of the solution .
The left top corner is 0,0 and the right bottom corner is 1,1  which is 0(black).
The right top corner is 1,0 and the left bottom corner is 0,1  which is 1(white).
Here ,I also learnt the use of layers api.
